Usually it's more articles around security and red teaming topics, but containerization also plays a significant role in modern environments. Even though dependencies that are installed separately from the OS package manager need to be checked independently since many security scanners struggle with that (at least that's my last understanding, it might have changed), higher speed when building containers is also important in many places.
Andrew Nesbitt shows in his article that most package managers (Cargo, Go, and Co.) for software development allow downloading dependencies separately.

Searchlight Cyber took a closer look at OpenText Directory Services (OTDS) and went really deep to find a deserialization vulnerability. Very much worth reading, in my opinion.
